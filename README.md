## 🌌 Overview

This repository explores the cycle of **stellar death and rebirth**, interpreted through both **astrophysics** and **philosophy**.
It connects scientific models of stellar evolution with symbolic thinking:

- **0 → Dissolution**: The end of a star’s life, returning to cosmic dust.
- **1 → Rebirth**: The formation of a new star, born from the remnants of the old.
- **∞ → Infinity**: The endless cycle of creation and destruction in the universe.

## 🔭 Stellar Evolution Cycle

1. **Nebula Formation** – Gas and dust collapse into a protostar.
2. **Main Sequence** – Hydrogen fusion powers a stable star.
3. **Red Giant / Supergiant** – Core contraction and outer layer expansion.
4. **Endings**
- *Low-Mass Stars*: White dwarf + planetary nebula.
- *High-Mass Stars*: Supernova → Neutron star / Black hole.
5. **Recycling** – Supernova remnants enrich space with heavy elements, forming new nebulae.

## 🌀 Philosophical Interpretation

- **0 (消減)** – All systems collapse, entropy dominates.
- **1 (重生)** – New order arises from previous destruction.
- **∞ (循環)** – The cycle is endless, mirroring both the cosmos and human civilization.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo acts as a **semantic and scientific archive**, bridging:

- **Astrophysics** → Understanding stellar life cycles.
- **Philosophy** → Exploring the metaphors of death and rebirth.
- **Civilization Insight** → Applying cosmic cycles to human resilience, governance, and renewal.
