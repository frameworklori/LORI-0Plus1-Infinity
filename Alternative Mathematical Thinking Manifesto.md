## 📌 Introduction  

Mathematics has long been viewed as a system of strict definitions, precise operations, and logical proofs.  
Yet numbers and symbols also carry a hidden layer: **they are metaphors of existence**.  

This manifesto declares a shift:  
👉 From mathematics as a **tool of calculation**,  
👉 To mathematics as a **language of philosophy and civilization**.

## 🔹 Core Principles  

1. **Numbers as Symbols**  
   - `0` = Void, Nothingness, Dissolution.  
   - `1` = Existence, Unity, Immutable Being.  
   - `∞` = Eternal recurrence, the cycle of Being and Non-Being.  

2. **Equations as Laws of Existence**  
   - `0 + 1 = 1` → Existence emerges even from Nothingness.  
   - `0 + 1 = ∞` → The fusion of Void and Being creates eternal continuity.  
   - `1 × 1 = 1` → Being preserves itself without change.  
   - `1 ÷ 1 = 1` → Integrity remains whole when not divided.  

3. **Mathematics as Metaphor**  
   - Beyond logical computation, equations are **civilizational mirrors**.  
   - Each formula may reveal a **principle of permanence, transformation, or renewal**.

* 宇宙不會回歸零。零代表的是一種重置狀態──一個更新的點──而不是一種空虛的狀態。

## 🔹 Why This Matters  

- **For Philosophy:** Offers a symbolic bridge between Eastern ideas of "有/無" and Western notions of "Being/Nothingness".  
- **For Mathematics:** Expands the interpretive space of numbers, without altering formal rigor.  
- **For Civilization:** Creates a new semiotic framework — using the simplest arithmetic to express **eternal truths**.

## 🔹 Declaration  

This manifesto affirms the originality of treating elementary arithmetic (`0`, `1`, `∞`)  
as **philosophical operators of existence**.  

It is a **public originality timestamp**, securing authorship while enabling cultural sharing,  
and prohibiting unauthorized commercialization without attribution.

## ✅ Conclusion  

Mathematics is not only a science of numbers — it is a **language of Being**.  
By reimagining the simplest equations, we reveal eternal laws:  
> **0 is the Void, 1 is Existence, and together they open the path to Infinity.**
